# Content Audit Report
## Paralogic Presents - Bruce Davison Event Website

**Audit Date:** January 13, 2026
**Compared:** Google Doc Event Details vs. Live Website

---

## Executive Summary

This audit compares the official event details from the Google Doc against the current website content. Several **critical discrepancies** were identified that need to be addressed.

---

## 1. Event Dates

| Item | Google Doc | Website | Status |
|------|------------|---------|--------|
| Event Dates | **March 27-29, 2026** | Not displayed | **MISSING** |

**Issue:** The website does not display the event dates anywhere. This is critical information for attendees.

**Recommendation:** Add dates to the hero section or itinerary header.

---

## 2. Event Title

| Item | Google Doc | Website | Status |
|------|------------|---------|--------|
| Event Name | "Lights / Canvas / Action" | "Bruce Davison: Lights / Canvas / Action" (meta description only) | **PARTIAL** |

**Issue:** The event title appears in the meta description but is not prominently displayed on the page itself.

**Recommendation:** Add the event title "Lights / Canvas / Action" as a visible headline.

---

## 3. Venue Location

| Item | Google Doc | Website | Status |
|------|------------|---------|--------|
| Venue Name | The Stage at Burke's Junction | Not displayed | **MISSING** |
| Address | 3300 Coach Lane, Cameron Park, CA 95682 | Not displayed | **MISSING** |

**Issue:** The venue information is completely absent from the website.

**Recommendation:** Add a dedicated location section or include venue details in the itinerary.

---

## 4. Friday Schedule

| Google Doc | Website | Status |
|------------|---------|--------|
| Ribbon Cutting | Ribbon Cutting Ceremony | **MATCH** |
| Art Gallery / Vendors | Art Gallery & Vendors Preview | **MATCH** |
| X-MEN (2000) Screening | X-Men (2000) Screening | **MATCH** |
| Q&A after screening | "Film screening followed by Q&A with Bruce Davison" | **MATCH** |

**Status:** Friday schedule is accurately represented.

---

## 5. Saturday Schedule

| Google Doc | Website | Status |
|------------|---------|--------|
| Art Gallery / Vendors | Art Gallery & Vendors | **MATCH** |
| Willard-themed Scavenger Hunt | Willard-Themed Scavenger Hunt | **MATCH** |
| Willard (1971) Screening | Willard (1971) Screening | **MATCH** |
| Live commentary | "Classic film with live commentary from Bruce Davison" | **MATCH** |

**Status:** Saturday schedule is accurately represented.

---

## 6. Sunday Schedule

| Google Doc | Website | Status |
|------------|---------|--------|
| Art Gallery / Vendors | Final Gallery & Vendors Day | **MATCH** |
| Live Discussion | Signing Event & Live Discussion | **MATCH** |
| Photo Opportunity | "Meet Bruce Davison - actor and painter" | **PARTIAL** |

**Issue:** The Google Doc mentions "Photo Opportunity" but the website only says "Meet Bruce Davison" without explicitly mentioning photo ops.

**Recommendation:** Add "Photo Opportunity" to Sunday's schedule.

---

## 7. About Section Content

| Item | Google Doc | Website | Status |
|------|------------|---------|--------|
| Event description | Multi-day immersive Bruce Davison experience | Generic photography description | **MISMATCH** |
| Bruce Davison bio | Actor/painter description | Generic photographer description | **MISMATCH** |

**Issue:** The About section on the homepage still contains placeholder photography content:
- "Capturing Moments in Time"
- "With over a decade of experience, I specialize in creating authentic, emotionally resonant photography..."
- Cards about "Portrait Photography", "Event Coverage", "Fine Art Prints"

This content does not reflect the Bruce Davison event at all.

**Recommendation:** Replace the About section with event-specific content describing Bruce Davison and the experience.

---

## 8. Ticket Pricing

| Item | Google Doc | Website | Status |
|------|------------|---------|--------|
| Ticket pricing | "To be announced" (incomplete in doc) | Not mentioned | **N/A** |

**Note:** The Google Doc indicates ticket pricing is still being finalized.

---

## 9. Hero/Carousel Content

| Item | Google Doc | Website | Status |
|------|------------|---------|--------|
| Hero messaging | Event-focused | Generic photography captions | **MISMATCH** |

**Issue:** The book carousel pages contain generic photography captions like:
- "Capturing Life's Moments"
- "Photography that tells your story"
- "Light & Shadow"
- etc.

These do not reflect the Bruce Davison event content.

**Recommendation:** Update carousel captions to reflect the event theme.

---

## Summary of Required Changes

### Critical (Must Fix)
1. **Add event dates** - March 27-29, 2026
2. **Add venue location** - The Stage at Burke's Junction, 3300 Coach Lane, Cameron Park, CA 95682
3. **Update About section** - Replace photography content with Bruce Davison/event content

### Recommended
4. **Add visible event title** - "Lights / Canvas / Action"
5. **Add Photo Opportunity** to Sunday schedule
6. **Update carousel captions** - Make them event-relevant

### Already Correct
- Friday schedule (Ribbon Cutting, Art Gallery, X-Men Screening with Q&A)
- Saturday schedule (Gallery, Scavenger Hunt, Willard with live commentary)
- Sunday schedule (Gallery, Discussion/Signing)
- Loading screen tagline mentions Bruce Davison

---

## Conclusion

The website's **itinerary/schedule section is well-aligned** with the Google Doc. However, several sections still contain **placeholder photography content** that needs to be replaced with Bruce Davison event-specific content. Most critically, the **event dates and venue location are missing entirely**.
